# Cross-Zero-Classic-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-on-JS
This repository contains a Tic Tac Toe game project I made as my practice project on JS.

Everyone grew up playing Tic-Tac-Toe as the best time passing game, mainly during boring lectures.

#### This game is made using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Needless to say, it runs on a browser.
  
### How to play:
1. Clone the repository and open the directory
2. Run index.html. (Remember to enable Scripts in your browser.)
  
#### Game Controls:
* Click on the box to mark it X or O.
* Odd turns are O and Even turns are X.

### Files Description:
* *index.html* - html code to decide what objects appear on page (thoroughly explained through comments)
* *cross_zero.css* - CSS code to make objects appear nice.
* *cross_zero.js* - JS code to add logic to game. (Explained thoroughly through comments)
* *jquery.js* - JQuery script to make JS easy and provide handlers.

## *Thanks for viewing my project.*
#### This project taught me basic jquery handlers. The biggest challenge with the project was to make the blocks lock once they are used. This part of code required lot of internet searching talent.
##### Hope you like the efforts.

Here's a snapshot of the game:
